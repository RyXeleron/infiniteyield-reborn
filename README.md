# Infinite Yield Reborn

A forked version of Infinite Yield thatâ€™s **better**.

### Although it might be slightly behind EdgeIY in updates, it's still a solid choice. Some features may have already been added to the script but not yet synced.

## Master Branch Loadstring

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://github.com/RyXeleron/infiniteyield-reborn/raw/master/source"))()
```

## IYStore x IYR (NFSW Plugins Removed / Reorganized)

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://github.com/RyXeleron/infiniteyield-reborn/raw/master/Infinite%20Store"))()
```

## IYRCMDLine (Reconstructed)

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://github.com/RyXeleron/infiniteyield-reborn/raw/master/IYRCMDBAR"))()
```
