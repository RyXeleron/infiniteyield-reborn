# Infinite Yield Reborn
A forked infinite yield but **better**.

Main Fork's Loadstring:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://github.com/RyXeleron/infiniteyield-reborn/raw/master/source"))()
```

IYStore x IYR **(NFSW Plugins Removed)**:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://github.com/RyXeleron/infiniteyield-reborn/raw/master/Infinite%20Store"))()
```

IYRCMDLine **(Reconstructed)**:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://github.com/RyXeleron/infiniteyield-reborn/raw/master/IYRCMDBAR"))()
```
